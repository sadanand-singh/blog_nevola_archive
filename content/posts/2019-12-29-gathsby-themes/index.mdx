2019 has been a year of gatsby updates for this site. So, I wanted to end this year with the same
spirit. After playing hours and hours with different features of gatsby, one feature that I have
really fallen for is - [gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/).

I have been using a heavily modified version of the theme developed by
[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/). It was good starting point and helped me learn a lot
about gatsby, react, javascript and css. However, adding any features have been little challenging.
I had to dig through different style files to change any component's css for its behavior in the
both the regular and dark modes. Nevertheless, I have added several components, including, Scroll
to Top Button on posts, TLDR and Update components for mdx, and ZoomImage and ImageGallery
components for mdx.

While developing these components and features, I have also been actively following gatsby
development. Specially for any new features that could make the UI development and maintainance
much easier. And this led me to gatsby themes. In this post, I want to describe the gatsby theme
I have used to build the new looks.

### Gatsby Themes

Gatsby themes allow Gatsby site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for others
(and yourself!) to easily reuse. Using a traditional starter, all of your default configuration
lives directly in your site. Using a theme, all of your default configuration lives in an npm
package.

My search for a great starting theme led me to
[novela](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela). Some of the cool features that I liked
from this theme are:

- dark mode
- different layouts for articles list with pagination
- medium-like image zoom and highlight text to share
- reading progress sidebar
- mailchimp newsletter subscription support
- multiple authors with profiles

Here is a gif to showcase some of these features:

However, the thing that attracted me the most to this theme was its friendliness for any type of
modifications. Its a very active project on github and well documented. Almost every component,
section of the theme can be easily modified.

In the following section, I will describe some of the major modifications that I made to the theme.

### Setting up the Novela Theme

First, following the official instructions, I set up things like logo, authors, site metadata,
mailchimp and authors.

The theme is based on mdx files, however, it lacks support for latext equations etc.

#### adding manifest and google analytics

This is needed to set a favicon properly and setting other manifests. This can be done via the
`gatsby-plugin-manifest` package. The exact settings in the `gatsby-config.js` can be found below.

Similarly, google analytics can be added via the `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics` package as shown
in the `gatsby-config.js` file below.

#### Math Support

First install katext and the corresponding gatsby package and then add plugins to the gatsby config.

```bash
yarn add katex gatsby-remark-katex
```

Then, update the `gatsby-config.js` as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `site title`,
    name: `site`,
    siteUrl: `localhost`,
    description: `your description`,

    // important to set the main text that appears in the hero
    hero: {
      heading: `Notes on AI, Health Care and Computers!`,
      maxWidth: 1052
    },
    social: [
      {
        name: `twitter`,
        url: `https://twitter.com/xxx`
      },
      {
        name: `github`,
        url: `https://github.com/yyy`
      },
      {
        name: `facebook`,
        url: `https://facebook.com/zzz/`
      },
      {
        name: `linkedin`,
        url: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrr/`
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@narative/gatsby-theme-novela',
      options: {
        authorsPage: true,
        mailchimp: true
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-mailchimp',
      options: {
        endpoint: 'xx'
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-manifest`,
      options: {
        name: `reckoning.dev by Sadanand`,
        short_name: `Sadanand`,
        start_url: `/`,
        background_color: `#fff`,
        theme_color: `#fff`,
        display: `standalone`,
        icon: `src/assets/favicon.png`
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`,
      options: {
        trackingId: 'UA-54080172-1'
      }
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {
              maxWidth: 10000,
              linkImagesToOriginal: false,
              quality: 80,
              withWebp: true
            }
          },
          `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`,
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-katex`,
            options: {
              strict: `ignore`,
              delimiters: [
                {
                  left: '\\\\begin{equation*}',
                  right: '\\\\end{equation*}',
                  display: true
                },
                { left: '$$', right: '$$', display: true },
                { left: '\\[', right: '\\]', display: true },
                { left: '$', right: '$', display: false },
                { left: '\\(', right: '\\)', display: false }
              ]
            }
          },
          { resolve: `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files` },
          { resolve: `gatsby-remark-numbered-footnotes` },
          { resolve: `gatsby-remark-smartypants` },
          {
            resolve: 'gatsby-remark-external-links',
            options: {
              target: '_blank',
              rel: 'noreferrer'
            }
          }
        ],
        remarkPlugins: [require(`remark-slug`)]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

In addition to updating the plugins used in the `gatsby-config.js`, we also need to add katex css
file to all posts. This can be done by importing those to `gatsby-browser.js` file.

```js
import 'katex/dist/katex.min.css';
import 'react-image-gallery/styles/css/image-gallery.css';
```

#### Image Gallery Components in mdx

Image gallery component from the [`react-image-gallery`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery)
npm package. All we need is to include the corresponding css file correctly. Similar to the math
support, we can add the corresponding css file to the `gatsby-browser.js` file.

```bash
yarn add react-image-gallery
```

#### tldr and update components

For adding messages like updates, tldr, I have also created simple components that can be used
directly in the mdx file. These components are based on the
[theme-ui](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-ui/) library. This library enables easy management
of css components for things like dark mode management, colors, and different screen sizes.
Then, we also need to modify the MDX component to add these to list of known components.

#### Code stats to navigation header

Converted old implementation of code stats page to a component. The full implementation of the
code stats can be found in [its implementation at github](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/reckoning.dev/blob/master/src/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/components/CodeStats/CodeStats.js).

Note that this implementation uses following npm plugins.

```bash
yarn add highcharts highcharts-react-official
```

Now, we can then create a dummy mdx post with `secret: true` enabled in the frontmatter. This
ensures that this post will not be listed in the main list of articles. Now, we can use the slug
of this post as a link to the code stats page.

Finally, We need to add the code stats icon to the navigation headers. This is also easily implemented
via the theme-ui plugin. See the details at [ CodeStatsLink implementation at github](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/reckoning.dev/blob/master/src/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/components/CodeStats/CodeStatsLink.tsx).

Finally, we can add the CodeStatsLink to the [navigation header page](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/reckoning.dev/blob/master/src/%40narative/gatsby-theme-novela/components/Navigation/Navigation.Header.tsx).

Checkout the final results at [this page](/code-stats).

So this brings to the final steps of my new setup. I hope this has brought me at the end of my
search for perfect gatsby setup. Hoping to keep this look and feel constant now for a foreseeable
future and focus more on other interesting topics here. Watch out for my year end post to look for
upcoming posts.
